The difference about being a kid is a kid don't want other kids to wait, they want them to wait up, would you wait up, everything with kids are up, wait up, hold up, shut up, Mom clean up, just let me stay up...with parent is the opposite, everything is down, carm down, slow down, sit down, put that down , you're grounded and keep that down there...
